/**
 * Class that defines the timing parameters and event handler of an AceButton or
 * a group of AceButton instances. It is assumed that in many cases, a group of
 * multiple buttons will need to be assigned the same configuration parameters.
 * For example, various timing delays and the EventHandler. Instead of storing
 * these parameters in each instance of AceButton (which consumes static
 * memory), we save space by collecting them into a separate ButtonConfig class.
 * Each AceButton instance contains a pointer to an instance of ButtonConfig,
 * and an instance of ButtonConfig will be shared among multiple AceButtons.
 *
 * Most of the parameters are actually hardwired into the various virtual
 * methods below. This has the advantage of reducing memory consumption of even
 * this class. If a parameter needs to be changed, there are 2 options:
 *
 * 1. Use the AdjustableButtonConfig subclass which allows all of these
 *    parameters to be changed at runtime, at the cost of additional static
      memory usage to hold those parameters.
 * 2. Subclass this ButtonConfig class, then override only the specific
 *    method to modify the specific timing parameter. This has the advantage
 *    of consuming no additional static RAM, at the expense of creating
 *    another class.
 *
 * A single default "System" ButtonConfig instance is created automatically and
 * can be accessed using the ButtConfig::getSystemButtonConfig() static method.
 * For convenience and ease of use, every instance of AceButton is attached to
 * this "System" ButtonConfig by default. The client code can override this
 * association by attaching another ButtonConfig instance using the
 * AceButton::setButtonConfig() method.
