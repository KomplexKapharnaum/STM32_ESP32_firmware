# KXKM - ESP32 Audio & battery module firmware

This repo is a complete Arduino sketchbook with libraries, hardware definitions, etc.

Clone it then point Arduino IDE to it using the Preferences > Sketchbook location.

_This repository contains submodules._

Git expects us to explicitly ask it to download the submodule's content. If you're cloning this repository for the first time, you can use a modified clone command to ensure you download everything, including any submodules:

	git clone --recursive <url>

In order to update the repository submodules content, you can execute the following command regularly:

git submodule update --recursive
